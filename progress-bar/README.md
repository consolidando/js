# Responsive Layout Example with Flexbox and Progress Bar

## Overview
This folder contains an example of a responsive layout using flexbox in HTML. The page features a progress bar inspired by YouTube. Both CSS and JavaScript are embedded within the document for easy portability and usage. This example is ideal for understanding how to create flexible layouts and add interactive features directly within an HTML file.

## How to Use
A Dockerfile is included, allowing you to serve the page using an nginx server. A Docker Compose file is also provided for local setup. However, it's not necessary as you can simply open the file in a JavaScript-enabled browser to access all its functionality.
